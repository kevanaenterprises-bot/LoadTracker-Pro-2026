# AFS eSubmit Compliance (Optional)
# Set to 'true' to make the "AFS eSubmit" button the default send action in the invoice
# email dialog for all customers. When enabled, the combined PDF attachment is named
# Invoice_<number>.pdf (no load-number suffix) per AFS eSubmit naming requirements.
# Leave as 'false' (or unset) to keep standard behaviour — the dedicated AFS eSubmit
# button is always available regardless of this setting.
