## [OPEN — HOOK]

*(Spokesperson standing, looking directly at camera. Clean background or subtle trucking imagery.)*

**SPOKESPERSON:**
"If you're running a trucking operation and paying $700 a month — or more — for your TMS, I need about three minutes of your time. Because what I'm about to show you is going to make you wonder why you've been overpaying for so long."

---

## [SECTION 1 — GEOFENCING & AUTOMATIC TIMESTAMPS]

*(Screen transitions to show the LoadTracker PRO dashboard with a load being created.)*

**SPOKESPERSON:**
"Let's start with the feature that changes everything — **automatic geofencing**.

When you create a load in LoadTracker PRO and assign it to a driver, the system automatically builds GPS geofences around every pickup and every delivery location. Not just the first and last stop — **every stop on that load**.

The moment your driver's phone crosses into one of those geofences — **automatic timestamp**. Pickup confirmed. Delivery confirmed. No phone calls. No text messages. No 'Hey, are you there yet?' Your driver just drives. The system handles the rest.

These timestamps are logged in real time, so you always have a verified record of exactly when your driver arrived and departed — without anyone lifting a finger."

---

## [SECTION 2 — LIVE GPS TRACKING]

*(Screen shows the Live Fleet Tracking map view with driver markers, speed, battery, and position data.)*

**SPOKESPERSON:**
"And while your drivers are on the road, LoadTracker PRO is tracking their GPS position every 30 seconds. You see exactly where every truck is on your **live tracking dashboard** — speed, heading, battery level, and a narrated location description so you know they're on I-40 westbound near Amarillo, not just a dot on a map.

No expensive hardware. No ELD add-ons. Your driver's phone **is** the tracking device."

---

## [SECTION 3 — HISTORICAL GPS MARKERS & ROUTE REPLAY]

*(Screen shows the position history / trail view on the map.)*

**SPOKESPERSON:**
"Every GPS position is saved. You can pull up any driver's **complete route history** and replay it on the map — point by point, with timestamps. Perfect for audits, customer inquiries, or resolving disputes. You'll always know exactly where your truck was and when."

---

## [SECTION 4 — HISTORY TOUR: ON-ROAD ENTERTAINMENT]

*(Screen shows the History Tour feature in the Driver Portal — the amber/orange UI with the toggle, scanning indicator, and narration playing.)*

**SPOKESPERSON:**
"Now here's something no other TMS on the market offers — and your drivers are going to love it.

It's called **History Tour**. When your driver has GPS sharing turned on, LoadTracker PRO is constantly scanning for historical markers along their route. There are over **200,000 historical marker sites** across the United States — Civil War battlefields, pioneer trails, gold rush towns, famous landmarks — they're everywhere, on every highway, in every state.

When your driver passes within 50 yards of one, a **voice narration automatically plays** through their phone speaker, telling the story of that place — who was there, what happened, and why it matters.

Here's the important part: **the driver never touches their phone.** They don't pick it up. They don't look at a screen. They don't tap anything. Eyes on the road. Hands on the wheel. The story just begins — and when it's done, it stops. A few miles later, another marker, another story.

It's on-road entertainment that doesn't create a single distraction. It's like having a knowledgeable tour guide riding shotgun — turning every long haul into something interesting. It's education, entertainment, and a real morale booster for drivers who spend hundreds of hours staring at the same highway."

---

## [SECTION 5 — DRIVER PORTAL & TRUCK-SAFE NAVIGATION]

*(Screen shows the Driver Portal on a mobile view — load details, route map, HERE Maps navigation.)*

**SPOKESPERSON:**
"Your drivers get their own **dedicated portal** — no app download required. It works right in their phone's browser.

From the Driver Portal, they can view their load details, accept or return a load, see their full route on a map, and launch **truck-safe navigation powered by HERE Maps** — routing that's optimized for 18-wheelers. That means it automatically avoids low bridges, weight-restricted roads, and hazardous material zones. Your driver taps one button and they're navigating safely."

---

## [SECTION 6 — AUTOMATIC INVOICING & POD WORKFLOW]

*(Screen shows the POD upload section, then transitions to the invoice being auto-generated and emailed.)*

**SPOKESPERSON:**
"Here's where the workflow gets really powerful — and where LoadTracker PRO saves you the most time.

When you create a load, assign it to a driver, and that driver completes the delivery — they upload the **Proof of Delivery** right from the Driver Portal. And the moment they do, LoadTracker PRO takes over.

The system **automatically attaches all the paperwork for that load** — the BOL, the rate confirmation, the POD documents, everything — to an **auto-generated invoice**. And that invoice is **emailed directly to your customer right then and there**.

You don't create the invoice. You don't attach documents. You don't hit send. **It's all automatic.** Load created, driver delivers, POD uploaded, invoice sent. Done.

And you'll receive a **confirmation email** letting you know the invoice was sent — so you always have peace of mind that your customer received it.

Now, here's something important — **the rate on that load is never visible to anyone you haven't given credentials to see it**. Your drivers don't see it. Unauthorized users don't see it. The financial details of your loads are protected by **role-based access control**, so only the people you trust have access to that information. Period."

---

## [SECTION 7 — IFTA REPORTING]

*(Screen shows the IFTA Report view — quarterly summary, state-by-state breakdown, GPS-tracked miles badge.)*

**SPOKESPERSON:**
"IFTA reporting? **It's included.** Not a $200-a-month add-on. Not a separate module you have to upgrade to. It's built right into LoadTracker PRO from day one.

LoadTracker PRO tracks your **state-by-state mileage using GPS data** from your drivers' routes. When it's time to file your quarterly IFTA report, you import your delivered loads with one click, and the system automatically calculates state miles, fuel taxes owed, fuel taxes paid, and your net tax position.

For loads where your driver had GPS tracking active, the state mileage is **GPS-verified** — not estimated. And you can export everything to CSV for your accountant or file it yourself. No spreadsheets. No guesswork. IFTA is included."

---

## [SECTION 8 — LOAD MANAGEMENT & DISPATCH]

*(Screen shows the load board, load creation modal, and SMS dispatch.)*

**SPOKESPERSON:**
"Of course, LoadTracker PRO handles all the fundamentals. **Create loads** with full details — pickup, delivery, extra stops, cargo description, rate, and customer information. **Dispatch loads to drivers via SMS** — they get a text message with a link to their Driver Portal where they can view and accept the load instantly.

Track every load through its full lifecycle — from created, to dispatched, to in transit, to delivered, to invoiced, to paid. You always know exactly where every load stands."

---

## [SECTION 9 — CUSTOMERS, LOCATIONS & RATE MATRIX]

*(Screen shows the Customers view, Locations database, and Rate Matrix.)*

**SPOKESPERSON:**
"Build your **customer database** and **saved locations** over time. The next time you create a load for the same customer or the same lane, the system auto-fills the details. Work smarter, not harder.

And with the **Rate Matrix**, you can save lane rates, track rate history, and quickly price new loads based on your actual data — not guesswork."

---

## [SECTION 10 — ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE & REVENUE]

*(Screen shows the AR view and dashboard stats.)*

**SPOKESPERSON:**
"Track your **accounts receivable**, see which invoices are outstanding, record payments, and monitor your **revenue analytics** from the dashboard. Pipeline visibility, delivered revenue, paid totals — your business health at a glance."

---

## [SECTION 11 — STAFF & ACCESS CONTROL]

*(Screen shows the Staff Management view.)*

**SPOKESPERSON:**
"Add dispatchers, office staff, and drivers — each with **role-based access control**. Your dispatcher sees what they need. Your drivers see what they need. Financial information stays with the people you authorize. And here's the best part — **there are no per-seat fees**. Add as many users as you want. Your price doesn't change."

---

## [SECTION 12 — TRY IT YOURSELF]

*(Spokesperson back on camera, warm and direct. Gestures toward screen.)*

**SPOKESPERSON:**
"Now, here's something I want to make sure you hear — because this is different from every other TMS company out there.

**You can go try LoadTracker PRO right now.** Go to **LoadTrackerPRO.com**, scroll down to the demo section, type in your name, and you're in. That's it. You'll get full access to an interactive demo with sample data — loads, drivers, tracking, invoicing, IFTA, the driver portal — everything we just talked about. You can click around and explore every single feature yourself.

**You don't have to call anyone. You don't have to schedule a meeting. You don't have to sit through a sales presentation.** There's no salesperson waiting to pounce. Nobody is going to call you. Nobody is going to email you. Nobody is going to 'just follow up to see if you had any questions.'

We don't do that. We're truckers, not telemarketers.

**You try it. You decide.** And if you like what you see, YOU reach out to us when YOU'RE ready. That's how it should work."

---

## [CLOSE — PRICING & CTA]

*(Spokesperson back on camera, confident and direct.)*

**SPOKESPERSON:**

Email confirmation to you. IFTA reporting. Truck-safe navigation. Driver portal. Load management. SMS dispatch. Customer database. Rate matrix. Revenue analytics. Staff access control.
